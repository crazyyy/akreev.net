== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= What is AI Power? =
AI Power is a complete AI package for WordPress that generates high-quality content, images, and forms using OpenAI's GPT-3 technology.

= What are the core features of AI Power? =
The core features include a Content Writer, Auto Content Writer, Image Generator, ChatGPT, WooCommerce Product Writer, AI Training, Fine-Tuner, Dataset Converter, PromptBase, GPT Forms and SEO Optimizer with support for 38 languages.  

= Can I customize the generated content? =
Yes, you can customize the generated content with options for writing style, tone, temperature, maximum tokens, and more.

= Does AI Power support WooCommerce integration? =
Yes, AI Power has WooCommerce integration, allowing you to optimize your product titles, descriptions, and short descriptions.

=Can I train the AI with my own data?=
Yes, you can train the AI using your own data with the Fine-Tuner and Dataset Converter. You can also create your own model and use it in the plugin.

=What is causing the timeout issue in the plugin?=
The timeout issue may be caused by a limit set on your web server, or by the use of a VPS, CDN, proxy, firewall, or Cloudflare.
To resolve the timeout issue, please contact your hosting provider and request an increase in the timeout limit.

=Is there a minimum timeout limit required for the plugin to work properly?=
The minimum timeout limit required for the plugin to work properly depends on the content settings, such as the number of headings, the language used, and the amount of additional content like an introduction or conclusion.
 
=I increased PHP max execution time, but I'm still getting a timeout issue. What should I do?=
The PHP max execution time setting determines the maximum amount of time a PHP script is allowed to run before it is terminated by the server. However, increasing this setting may not necessarily resolve a timeout issue if there are other factors involved, such as the size and complexity of the content being generated or other server-side configurations like VPS, CDN, proxy, firewall, or Cloudflare. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the timeout limit set by your hosting provider in order to resolve the issue.

=I received the error message "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details." What does this mean?=
This message is coming from OpenAI, not from our plugin. It means that you have reached the limit of your OpenAI API quota, which is determined by your plan and billing details. Our plugin works on a "bring your own API key" model, serving as a bridge between WordPress and OpenAI, so the issue is not related to the plugin itself. To resolve this issue, you'll need to check your OpenAI account and ensure that you have enough quota for your needs, or upgrade your plan if necessary.
