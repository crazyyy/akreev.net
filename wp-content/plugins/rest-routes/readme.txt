Have you ever thought about the possibility of adding custom endpoints for WP REST API without touching a single line of PHP? That can be easily done with Rest Routes! It lets you build awesome custom endpoints for your site.

You can create unlimited custom routes for your site using a very friendly interface. In a very few steps and you will have your new endpoint available through WP REST API:

* Give the custom endpoint a name
* Customize it with as many filters as you wish
